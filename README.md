# Deep Dense Multi-Path Neural Network For Prostate Segmentation In Magnetic Resonance Imaging [(Paper)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-018-1841-4)
This repository contains the code for prostate segmentation in MRI using deep dense multi-path neural network. 

The Preprocessing and Augmentation pipeline are designed specifically for PROMISE12 dataset. However, they can be easily extended for using with other datasets.

The CNN Architecture proposed in our paper:
